rsDeck turns a [LilyGo T-Deck Plus](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t-deck-plus)
into a two-mode Reticulum handheld. Standalone mode is an on-device
Ratspeak/LXMF messenger. RNode mode makes the T-Deck a host-controlled radio
for Ratspeak, Sideband, or another Reticulum client over BLE or USB serial.

## Install

Use the Ratspeak web flasher:
[ratspeak.org/download.html](https://ratspeak.org/download.html).

Put the T-Deck Plus in download mode by holding the trackball while powering on,
connect USB, then flash `rsdeck-full`. The standalone-only and RNode-only
images are release artifacts for launcher users or focused testing.

## Modes

On boot, the launcher lets you choose:

- **Standalone**: a local Reticulum/LXMF messenger with identity management,
  contacts, peer discovery, messages, LoRa, and WiFi TCP access.
- **RNode**: a host-controlled RNode-style radio target for Ratspeak or other
  Reticulum clients over BLE or USB serial.

RNode mode self-provisions the T-Deck RNode product/model/default config and
running firmware hash on first boot, so users should not need a separate
`rnodeconf` setup step for the bundled release images.

## Basic Use

On first boot, Standalone mode generates a Reticulum identity and asks for a
display name. Your LXMF address is the 32-character hex string you share with
contacts.

- Tabs: Home, Friends, Msgs, Peers, Setup.
- Navigation: trackball movement and click/Enter.
- Announce: press the trackball or Enter on the Home tab.
- Add contacts: select a discovered peer, then open or save the chat.
- Send messages: open a chat, type, and press Enter.
- Delivery color: yellow while sending, green after delivery confirmation.
- Identity import: place one raw 64-byte Reticulum identity file under
  `/ratdeck/identity/` on the SD card, then use Setup -> Import Identity.
  Files named `import.identity` or `import.key` are preferred; otherwise rsDeck
  accepts exactly one non-reserved `.identity` or `.key` file in that folder.
  Ratspeak's encrypted `.rsi` backups are not imported on-device; from Ratspeak,
  export a Reticulum Identity File for rsDeck import.

## Radio Presets

`Long Fast` is the compiled-in default. All radio parameters can also be tuned
from Setup. Changes apply immediately.

| Preset | SF | BW | CR | TXP | Bitrate | Link budget |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Short Turbo | 7 | 500 kHz | 4/5 | 14 dBm | 21.99 kbps | 140 dB |
| Short Fast | 7 | 250 kHz | 4/5 | 14 dBm | 10.84 kbps | 143 dB |
| Short Slow | 8 | 250 kHz | 4/5 | 14 dBm | 6.25 kbps | 145.5 dB |
| Medium Fast | 9 | 250 kHz | 4/5 | 17 dBm | 3.52 kbps | 148 dB |
| Medium Slow | 10 | 250 kHz | 4/5 | 17 dBm | 1.95 kbps | 150.5 dB |
| Long Turbo | 11 | 500 kHz | 4/8 | 22 dBm | 1.34 kbps | 150 dB |
| **Long Fast** *(default)* | **11** | **250 kHz** | **4/5** | **22 dBm** | **1.07 kbps** | **153 dB** |
| Long Moderate | 11 | 125 kHz | 4/8 | 22 dBm | 0.34 kbps | 156 dB |

## WiFi Bridging

WiFi bridging is experimental. STA mode can connect to existing WiFi and reach
remote Reticulum nodes such as `rns.ratspeak.org:4242`.

AP mode exposes a local TCP endpoint for a nearby Reticulum host:

```ini
[[rsdeck]]
  type = TCPClientInterface
  target_host = 192.168.4.1
  target_port = 4242
```

The bridging UI and interface behavior may change as Ratspeak's client release
stabilizes.

## Build From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ratspeak/rsDeck
cd rsDeck
python3 -m pip install platformio esptool
make prep-tdeck
make package
make flash port=/dev/cu.usbmodem3101
```

Useful build targets:

```bash
make build-launcher      # launcher only
make build-standalone    # standalone messenger app
make build-rnode         # host-controlled RNode target
make full-image          # launcher + Standalone + RNode
make package             # release zips and launcher bins
```

Release artifacts are written to `dist/`:

```text
dist/rsdeck-full.zip
dist/rsdeck-standalone.zip
dist/rsdeck-rnode.zip
dist/rsdeck-standalone-m5launcher.bin
dist/rsdeck-rnode-m5launcher.bin
```

Use the `.zip` files with the Ratspeak web flasher. The `*-m5launcher.bin`
files are app images for M5Launcher/M5Burner-style launchers that boot
Standalone or RNode directly from SD.
